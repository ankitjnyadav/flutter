Flutter is Bespoke

Why is Flutter Fast?

1 . Engine - SKIA - Graphics Rendering Engine
2.  hot reload (stateful)


Flutter is framework/platform as we make use of existing infrastructure developed by others.

main.dart in the "lib" folder is the entrypoint (by default) of the flutter app.
App and its dependent activies will launch from there.
Futher more it will look for the main function.

Look and feel (how it looks like) is known as UI.


Output the Data:
1. Console/Terminal - print()
2. Network - send() [Assume, send as a function]
3. Mobile App - Text()

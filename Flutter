Flutter is Bespoke

What is Bespoke Software?
Bespoke software is a software application developed specifically to your custom requirements and is particularly
used when there is no 'off the shelf' alternative available.

Same "codebase"

Why Flutter?
Beautiful UI/UX

Flutter can be used to create
1. iOS App
2. Android App

Why is Flutter Fast?

1 . Engine - SKIA - Graphics Rendering Engine
2.  hot reload (stateful)


Flutter is framework/platform as we make use of existing infrastructure developed by others.

main.dart in the "lib" folder is the entrypoint (by default) of the flutter app.
App and its dependent activies will launch from there.
Futher more it will look for the main function.

Look and feel (how it looks like) is known as UI.


Output the Data:
1. Console/Terminal - print()
2. Network - send() [Assume, send as a function]
3. Mobile App - Text()


What is Hot Reload?

class MyHotApp extends StatelessWidget {
  build(BuildContext c1) {
    return MyApp();
  }
}


To get the package:
Goto:  http://pub.dev/

Add -> flutter_statusbarcolor: ^0.2.3
In the file under dependencies section: pubspec.yaml
run flutter pub get
